To run the web application, there are several steps that must be completed:

    Due to the complexity of the app, we've decided to develop and maintain it in a 
    manner that makes it suitable for execution within a development container (based on Docker).
    
1) Visit the Docker Desktop download page and download the package appropriate for your system: Docker Desktop    
2) After downloading and installing, launch the Docker Desktop application.
3) Download the repository (or clone it locally) and open it in Visual Studio Code.
4) Next, download the DevContainer extension for VS Code.
5) After installation, press Ctrl+Shift+P and type 'Build and Open in Container' (note that it starts with 'Dev Containers:').
The development container will open. At this point, you'll need to wait for the container build process to complete.

6) Once the build is finished, navigate to the top bar where the project name and magnifying glass icon are displayed (this is where you initially ran the build command). Click on 'Run Task' and select 'Run All'. This will initiate the backend, frontend, Flask, and Prisma UI services.
\
By following these steps, you should be able to successfully run the web application in a development container.
